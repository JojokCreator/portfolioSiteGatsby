        <div className={styles.container}>
            <p className={styles.text}> I am used to work in a high performance tech team using agile working methods and user-driven design to create UI/UX, but am also comfortable working alone.
            I have built a number of REST APIâ€™s linked to databases and front-ends in React which fetched data from those services. I focus on testing and modern software engineering practices using jest, cypress and react-testing. For version control I use git to track different versions of my code and collaborate with other developers
