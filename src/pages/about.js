        <div className={styles.container}>
            <p className={styles.text}>After spending the majority of my life in hospitality and resort management. I am looking to change my career path towards using my passion and knowledge in website design and coding.
            I have just completed the School of Code where I learnt how to work in a high performance tech team using agile working methods and user-driven design to create UI/UX. I have built  a number of REST APIâ€™s linked to databases and front-ends in React which fetched data from those services. We focused on testing and modern software engineering practices using jest, cypress and react-testing. We used git for version control.
