A simple todo list built in React.JS as part of a project. I worked with another bootcamper using pair programming and Agile working methods to produce this in a day.
<br></br>
## Features
<li>Ability to add new todos to the list</li>
<li>Toggle the todo as done</li>
<li>Filter the todo's by pending, done or show all</li>
<li>Delete a todo</li>

The styling is done using Semantic UI but could still do with a little work on the aesthetics.
