Blog app with components that display posts and comments and allow users to add new comments. Made with React. It includes react-testing to make sure it functions in the correct way.

The page is basically styled with css and is fully responsive. It was designed with mobile-first design.


## Features

  - If the comment is empty, it wont get added.
  - Provides a default name for the author if left blank.
  - After adding the comment clears the input for comment but not the input for the name

The project was made in a few hours over the weekend as a school of code recap task.
