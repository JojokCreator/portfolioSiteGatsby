As part of School of Code I built a weather checker app using TypeScript and React with another bootcamper using pair programming. We planned the app here [Here](https://github.com/JojokCreator/React-Weather-App---Typescript/blob/main/plan.drawio) and broke the day into mini-sprints/chunks and collectively agree on what work can be completed during each sprint.
<br></br>
### Features

<li>The app is written in TypeScript.</li>
<li>The user is able to input the name of a city and have weather information about that city added to the page. </li>
<li>We added a dark mode toggle that uses useContext to wrap the app and change CSS styles globally.</li>

### Additional plans

<li>UI/component libraries - I have added a little Mantine but still needs more work.</li>

<li>Tests</li>
