As part of School of Code I built a weather checker app using TypeScript and React with another bootcamper using pair programming. We planned the app here [Here](https://github.com/JojokCreator/React-Weather-App---Typescript/blob/main/plan.drawio) and broke the day into mini-sprints/chunks and collectively agree on what work can be completed during each sprint.

### Code and functionality

- The app is written in TypeScript.
- The user is able to input the name of a city and have weather information about that city added to the page. 
- We added a dark mode toggle that uses useContext to wrap the app and change CSS styles globally.

## Additional plans

- UI/component libraries - I have added a little Mantine-UI but still needs more work.

- Tests
