## Implimentation
Although we were limited on time ( the whole project took one day) we did manage to get some sort of a MVP [Here](https://jojokcreator.github.io/Crypto-Landing-Page) the page initially looks ok but is not responsive to smaller screen types and needs more time. 

I initially build the page in Html and CSS but have recently re-done the page with next JS. I added a few pages and used an API to grab information about a few currencies in the coins page.
