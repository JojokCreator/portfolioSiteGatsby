Movie Madness - a one day React app built in our week 8 hackathon at school of code. We chose the OMDB movie API to fetch from in a full stack React app.
Styled with Tailwind

### What We Did

You need to create an .env file and add an API key from the OMDB site under the name REACT_APP_APIKEY

Once loaded just type in a movie, series or video game.
